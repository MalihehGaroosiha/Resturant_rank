# In this project, I am analyzing the data from 'yelp_data.csv' to estimate the rank of a restaurant. Imagine a scenario where a customer is planning to open a new coffee shop and is expecting to receive 200 reviews from its customers. To assess how this coffee shop might rank compared to others, I'm considering various features such as the restaurant's location, the category of food it serves, and the number of reviews it receives within a specific time frame. By analyzing this data, I aim to determine whether the new restaurant falls within the average range compared to others or if it stands out in any particular way.
